{gS} Framework is a content management / blog aware system built from the ground up utilising jekyll for compilation of code and it's amazing templating system. As it states in the excerpt one of our main concerns is security that's why we are building the framework with security in mind. 

We feature clean code, from scratch with a Modular approach just like most things are built now-a-days. After more than a decades worth of experience development and design things have generally got easier and a lot of the mundane tasks can be inserted with ease just by writing a few lines of code.

Later we will be implementing the Framework with CodeIgniter which will then become the {gS} Content Management System, focused on code alone and with a very small footprint.

{gS} Linux is also being built utilising Arch Linux and the AWESOME Tiling Window Manager / i3 Tiling Window Manager, the focus for this will simply be to code, hence a minimal environment to work from. With the possibility of deployment via thin clients in a commercial environment. 

Keep up to date with this page as there is a lot more to come. Updates happen weekly / monthly basis.
